Task 3 — School Test & Proficiency Rates (6-8 min)
Using the cleaned roster (roster_clean) and your Spring assessment file (spring_latest), calculate two school-level metrics:

Spring Test Rate

Definition: The proportion of rostered students at a school who have any Spring assessment record.
Spring Proficiency Rate

Definition: Among students tested in Spring at a school, the proportion who are Proficient or Advanced on at least one subject.
Instructions
Begin by left-joining roster_clean to spring_latest on student_id to bring in each student’s school.
Deduplicate appropriately so each student is only counted once per school.
Compute the two rates defined above.
Display a tidy dataframe named school_rates with exactly these three columns:
school
spring_test_rate
spring_prof_rate
