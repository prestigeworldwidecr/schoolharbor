This is a short excercise set focused on practical data wrangling you’ll see in K‑12 analytics.

What’s inside

Synthetic K‑12 datasets (SIS roster, attendance, assessments, program seats).
4 quick Pandas tasks + 1 SQL companion (run SQL against the same data via SQLite).
A small helper function exercise.
You may consult official library docs. Please do not use AI code completion/agents.

Setup (Run Once) 
Generates synthetic CSVs to ./data and prepares a SQLite database (schoolharbor.db) with the same tables for the SQL section.

*** setup_run_once.py ***

Saved CSVs to ./data
SQLite database created: schoolharbor.db (tables: roster, attendance, assessments, programs, program_enrollments)
